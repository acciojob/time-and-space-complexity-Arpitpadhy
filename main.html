	<h1>Knowing about Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. 
    An algorithm with lower time complexity is generally more efficient, meaning it can handle larger inputs faster.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs relative to the input size. 
    For example, an algorithm with Space Complexity of O(n) requires memory proportional to the number of elements it processes.</p>
